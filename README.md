## ðŸ§ª Testing & CI

Writegeist ships with lightweight smoke tests for the AI-extraction pipeline.

```bash
# In one terminal start the backend
cd ai-service && . .venv/Scripts/activate
uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload

# In another terminal
pytest -q ai-service/tests
```

The tests POST fixture chapters and assert that characters, locations, and summaries are extracted correctly.
(Optionally wire this into GitHub Actions later.)
