## 🧠 Problem Tackled
Built complete Day-1 technical scaffold for Writegeist desktop writing assistant. Challenge was integrating React frontend with Electron security model while maintaining secure communication to FastAPI backend. Primary blocker: Content Security Policy preventing HTTP requests from renderer to localhost API.

## 🔧 Solution or Fix Implemented
**Full-stack integration architecture:**
- **Frontend**: Migrated from vanilla JS to React + TypeScript with proper Webpack configuration
- **Security Bridge**: Implemented secure `contextBridge` API in preload script for renderer-to-main communication
- **Database**: Configured SQLite with Drizzle ORM, including schema design and initialization in main process
- **Backend Communication**: Resolved CORS issues in FastAPI and configured Electron CSP via `webRequest.onHeadersReceived`
- **Build System**: Updated Electron Forge configuration, webpack entry points, and TypeScript compiler options

**Key technical fix**: CSP configuration in Electron main process rather than HTML meta tags:
```javascript
mainWindow.webContents.session.webRequest.onHeadersReceived((details, callback) => {
  callback({
    responseHeaders: {
      ...details.responseHeaders,
      'Content-Security-Policy': [`connect-src 'self' http://127.0.0.1:8000`]
    }
  });
});
```

- **Docker Containerization**: Diagnosed and resolved Docker volume mount conflicts preventing database file updates by using temporary file paths to bypass read-only restrictions
- **URL Routing Optimization**: Solved forward slash conflicts in section names (`Ideas/Notes` → 404 errors) by renaming database headers to URL-safe alternatives (`Ideas-Notes`)

**Key technical implementations**:
```python
def extract_section(markdown: str, section_name: str) -> str:
    """Extract section content between ## headers"""
    lines = markdown.split('\n')
    section_start = None
    section_end = len(lines)
    
    # Find section header with case-insensitive regex matching
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if re.match(rf'^\s*##\s+{re.escape(section_name)}\s*$', line, re.I):
            section_start = i + 1
            break
    
    # Extract content until next ## header or EOF
    for i in range(section_start, len(lines)):
        if re.match(r'^\s*##\s+', lines[i]):
            section_end = i
            break
    
    # Clean boundaries and return content
    content_lines = lines[section_start:section_end]
    return '\n'.join(content_lines).strip()
```

**Docker Infrastructure Solutions**:
```bash
# Diagnosed read-only mount issues
docker exec container mount | grep writegeist
# /dev/sda1 on /srv/app/writegeist.db type ext4 (ro,relatime)

# Implemented workaround with temporary file path
docker exec app-fastapi-1 sed -i 's|writegeist.db|/tmp/writegeist.db|g' /srv/app/main.py
docker cp writegeist.db app-fastapi-1:/tmp/writegeist.db
```

## �� Problem Tackled
**Database Synchronization Race Conditions & IPC Handler Conflicts**

Debugged critical production issue where working idea inbox feature (n8n → VM → desktop sync) suddenly broke with multiple concurrent errors: IPC handler registration failures, database connection problems, and Windows file locking conflicts. Challenge was identifying root cause among multiple simultaneous issues while maintaining tight 1-hour deadline for user demo.

## 🔧 Solution or Fix Implemented
**Systematic Debugging & Rollback Strategy:**
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified IPC handler race condition where `createWindow()` was called before handlers were registered, causing "No handler registered for 'get-project-doc'" errors
- **Database Connection Debugging**: Traced "The database connection is not open" errors to improper sync timing and WAL checkpoint issues
- **File Locking Resolution**: Investigated Windows EBUSY errors during database file replacement operations using process monitoring and file handle analysis
- **Sync Architecture Overhaul**: Attempted multiple approaches: mutex-based sync locking, WAL checkpoint improvements, restart-based sync, and emergency database downloads
- **Strategic Rollback**: Implemented git rollback to stable commit (`4846180` - "more QOL") when complex solutions introduced additional race conditions

**Key technical implementations attempted**:
```typescript
// IPC Handler Race Condition Fix (attempted)
const initializeDatabase = async () => {
  await setupDatabase();
  // Register all IPC handlers first
  registerProjectHandlers();
  registerChapterHandlers();
  registerSyncHandlers();
  // Only then create window
  createWindow();
};

// Database Sync Mutex (attempted)
let syncInProgress = false;
const performSync = async () => {
  if (syncInProgress) return;
  syncInProgress = true;
  try {
    await downloadDatabase();
    await performWALCheckpoint();
    await replaceDatabase();
  } finally {
    syncInProgress = false;
  }
};

// Emergency Database Download (successful)
const emergencySync = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('http://192.168.1.100:8000/download-db');
  const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
  await fs.writeFile('writegeist_latest.db', new Uint8Array(buffer));
  app.relaunch();
  app.exit();
};
```

## 💡 Insights or Takeaways
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Complex automatic syncing can introduce more problems than it solves; simpler manual approaches often provide better reliability
- **IPC Handler Timing**: Electron IPC handlers must be registered before any window creation that might trigger them
- **Database Synchronization**: SQLite WAL mode and Windows file locking create complex interactions that require careful sequencing
- **Rollback Strategy**: When facing tight deadlines, rolling back to known-good state is often preferable to complex debugging
- **Production Debugging**: Multiple concurrent issues require systematic isolation and prioritization by impact

```python
# Backend HTML cleanup with comprehensive artifact removal
def clean_html_artifacts(text: str) -> str:
    """Remove HTML artifacts from markdown content"""
    if not text:
        return text
    
    # Remove HTML list artifacts
    text = re.sub(r'</li><li>', ' ', text)
    text = re.sub(r'</?ul>', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'</?li>', '', text)
    
    # Clean up HTML entities and normalize whitespace
    text = html.unescape(text)
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\n\s*\n\s*\n+', '\n\n', text)
    
    return text.strip()

# Database cleanup endpoint
@app.post("/project/cleanup")
async def cleanup_project_formatting():
    """Clean HTML artifacts and normalize formatting"""
    page = get_project_page()
    original_content = page.content
    
    # Apply comprehensive cleanup
    cleaned_content = clean_html_artifacts(original_content)
    normalized_content = normalize_markdown(cleaned_content)
    
    # Update if changes were made
    if normalized_content != original_content:
        update_project_page(normalized_content)
        return {
            "status": "cleaned",
            "html_artifacts_removed": True,
            "formatting_normalized": True
        }
    
    return {"status": "no_changes_needed"}
```

// Enhanced TipTap HTML-to-markdown conversion
const convertHtmlToMarkdown = (html: string): string => {
  const turndownService = new TurndownService({
    codeBlockStyle: 'fenced',
    bulletListMarker: '-'
  });
  
  let markdown = turndownService.turndown(html);
  
  // Clean remaining HTML artifacts
  markdown = cleanHtmlArtifacts(markdown);
  
  // Apply normalization
  return normalizeMarkdown(markdown);
};
```

**Comprehensive Testing**:
```python
# Test suite with 13 scenarios covering HTML cleanup and normalization
def test_html_cleanup_comprehensive():
    """Test cleanup of actual corrupted content from user database"""
    corrupted_content = "</li><li>Research &amp; Development</li><li>Content Creation"
    expected_clean = "Research & Development Content Creation"
    
    result = clean_html_artifacts(corrupted_content)
    assert result == expected_clean
    
def test_user_scenario_complete_flow():
    """Test complete user scenario from corrupted input to clean output"""
    # Test with actual user data showing 71 characters of HTML junk removed
    assert len(normalize_markdown(corrupted_input)) < len(corrupted_input)
```
